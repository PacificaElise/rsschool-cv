I like solving complex problems: developing websites and web applications with a user-friendly interface. I am fascinated by the development process and the opportunity to create convenient and useful products.\

Completed the "Frontend Developer" course in Itgirlschool. I constantly practice programming.

```JS
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function() {
  return this.split(' ')
    .map((el) => el[0].toUpperCase() + el.toLowerCase().slice(1))
    .join(' ');
};
```
