#### 👩‍💻 About me:

I like solving complex problems: developing websites and web applications with a user-friendly interface. I am fascinated by the development process and the opportunity to create convenient and useful products.\
My works can be seen here: https://github.com/stars/PacificaElise/lists/my-stack.

Completed the "Frontend Developer" course in Itgirlschool. I constantly practice programming.

```JS
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function() {
  return this.split(' ')
    .map((el) => el[0].toUpperCase() + el.toLowerCase().slice(1))
    .join(' ');
};
```

I am open to offers for the position of frontend developer, I strive to develop together with the company. I will be glad to cooperate.\
